## HOW TO DECIDE ON WHICH SPOT TO MINE?

Mine spots that we can reach before the enemy





## HOW TO DECIDE ON WHAT UNIT TO BUILD?

### **Information given**

Enemy seen last turn by castle. Closest enemy seen this turn by castle. Was it a prophet? Was it a mage?

Number of units of each type last round

Number of fuel spots, karbonite spots

### One Castle:

We start with 100 karbonite, 500 fuel

Build Queue = [2, 2, 4, 4, 4]; 2 pilgrims, 3 prophets



**ALWAYS:**

IF we see an enemy incoming:

Produce units to defend against it. Prophets are usually good

Build some preachers behind prophets to defend short range.

â€‹	

Analyze the approaching unit?



**In General...**

Stack karbonite and don't build units if we have less than 50 karbonite. Used to allow pilgrims to build churches earlier



Do we need to stack karbonite on a one castle map? Do we need the karbonite to be flexible?
