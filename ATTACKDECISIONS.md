# Attacking Strategies/MICRO



## Defending our castle

Line up prophets in front of mages

**Prophets:**

Prophets always target an enenmy prophet and then the nearest enemy if it has mages to help protect it. No kiting

Otherwise prophets always target the nearest enemy. Kite?

**Mages:**

Attack nearest unit and avoid hitting our own units at all costs. Mages must be pushed up close to front line
